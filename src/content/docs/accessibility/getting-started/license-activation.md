4. Your license key is sent to your email

## Activate Your License

### One-Click Pro Install (Recommended)

1. Go to **Accessibility → License** in your WordPress admin
2. Enter your license key
3. Click **Validate & Install Pro**
4. Pro downloads and installs automatically

No ZIP files to download or upload.

## License Types

| License | Sites | Price |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Pro | 1 site | $79/year |
| Agency | Unlimited | $299/year |

Staging and local development sites don't count against your limit.

## Managing Your License

### Moving to a New Site

1. Go to **Accessibility → License** on the old site
2. Click **Deactivate License**
3. Activate on your new site

### Renewals

Licenses renew annually. If your license expires:

- The plugin continues to work
- You won't receive new updates
- Priority support access ends

Renew from the link in your expiration reminder email.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid license key"

- Check for typos or extra spaces
- Ensure you copied the complete key
- Verify your license hasn't expired

### "Activation limit reached"

Your Pro license is active on another site. Deactivate it there first, or upgrade to Agency for unlimited sites.

### "Could not connect to license server"

Your server can't make outbound HTTPS requests. Check that:

- Your hosting allows outbound HTTPS connections
- No firewall is blocking external API calls
- cURL is enabled on your server

If issues persist, email support@wooplugin.pro with your license key.
