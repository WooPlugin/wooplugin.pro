## Why Activate?

Your license key unlocks:

- **Automatic updates** directly from your WordPress dashboard
- **Priority support** via email
- **All Pro features** for the licensed site

## Finding Your License Key

Your license key was sent to your email after purchase. You can also find it in your [account dashboard](https://wooplugin.pro/account):

1. Log in at wooplugin.pro
2. Go to **Licenses**
3. Copy your license key

License keys look like this: `WPRO-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`

## Activating Your License

1. Go to **WooCommerce → Product Feed → Settings**
2. Click the **License** tab
3. Enter your license key
4. Click **Activate License**

You should see a green success message confirming activation.

## License Types

| License | Sites | Price |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Pro | 1 site | $7/month |
| Agency | Unlimited | $25/month |

## Managing Activations

Each license can be activated on a limited number of sites. To move your license to a new site:

1. Go to your [account dashboard](https://wooplugin.pro/account)
2. Navigate to **Licenses**
3. Click **Manage Sites** next to your license
4. Deactivate the old site
5. Activate on the new site

You can also deactivate directly from the plugin:

1. Go to **WooCommerce → Product Feed → Settings → License**
2. Click **Deactivate License**

## Staging and Development Sites

Staging and local development sites (containing "staging", "dev", "test", or "local" in the domain) do not count against your activation limit. They're automatically detected and marked as development sites.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid license key"

- Double-check for typos or extra spaces
- Ensure you're using a Pro license key (starts with `WPRO-`)
- Check that your license hasn't expired

### "Activation limit reached"

You've used all available activations. Deactivate an existing site first, or upgrade to a higher tier license.

### "Could not connect to license server"

This usually means your server can't reach our API. Check that:

- Your hosting allows outbound HTTPS connections
- No firewall is blocking `api.wooplugin.pro`
- Your SSL certificate is valid

If issues persist, [contact support](/#contact) with your license key and we'll help resolve it.

## Renewals

Licenses are annual subscriptions. You'll receive a reminder email before expiration. Renewing ensures continued access to updates and support.

If your license expires:

- The plugin continues to work
- You won't receive new updates
- Priority support access ends

Renew anytime from your [account dashboard](https://wooplugin.pro/account).
