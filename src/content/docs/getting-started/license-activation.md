description: How to activate your Pro license to receive updates and support.

## Why Activate?

Your license key unlocks:

- **Automatic updates** directly from your WordPress dashboard
- **Priority support** via email
- **All Pro features** for the licensed site

## Finding Your License Key

Your license key was sent to your email after purchase. You can also find it in your customer portal:

1. Check your purchase confirmation email
2. Or log in to your customer portal (link in email)
3. Copy your license key

## Activating Your License

1. Go to **WooCommerce → Product Feed → Settings**
2. Click the **License** tab
3. Enter your license key
4. Click **Activate License**

You should see a green success message confirming activation.

## License Types

| License | Sites | Price |
|---------|-------|-------|
| Pro | 1 site | $7/month |
| Agency | Unlimited | $25/month |

## Managing Activations

**Pro licenses** allow 1 site activation. To move your license to a different site:

1. Go to **WooCommerce → Product Feed → Settings → License**
2. Click **Deactivate License**
3. Activate on your new site

**Agency licenses** allow unlimited activations—use on as many sites as you need.

## Troubleshooting

### "Invalid license key"

- Double-check for typos or extra spaces
- Ensure you copied the complete key
- Check that your license hasn't expired

### "Activation limit reached" (Pro only)

Your Pro license is already active on another site. Deactivate it there first, or upgrade to Agency for unlimited sites.

### "Could not connect to license server"

This usually means your server can't reach our API. Check that:

- Your hosting allows outbound HTTPS connections
- No firewall is blocking `api.wooplugin.pro`
- Your SSL certificate is valid

If issues persist, [contact support](/#contact) with your license key and we'll help resolve it.

## Renewals

Licenses are valid for 1 year. You'll receive a reminder email before expiration. Renewing ensures continued access to updates and support.

If your license expires:

- The plugin continues to work
- You won't receive new updates
- Priority support access ends

Renew from the link in your expiration reminder email or contact support.
