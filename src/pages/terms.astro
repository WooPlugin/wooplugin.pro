          <p>
            By downloading, installing, or using WooPlugin products and services, you acknowledge that you have read,
            understood, and agree to be bound by these terms of service. If you do not agree to these terms,

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-text mb-4">License</h2>
          <p>
            Our WordPress plugins are released under the GNU General Public License v2 or later (GPLv2+).
            You are free to use, modify, and distribute the code according to the terms of that license.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            The full license text is available at
            <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-primary hover:text-primary-dark">

          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Important:</strong> While the code is GPL-licensed, purchasing a Pro license grants you access
            to our update and support services. The GPL covers the software code; our commercial licenses cover
            the services (updates, support, license key activation).
          </p>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-text mb-4">Pro License Terms</h2>
          <p>
            When you purchase a Pro or Agency license, you receive:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li><strong>Pro License:</strong> Valid for one (1) WordPress installation</li>
            <li><strong>Agency License:</strong> Valid for unlimited WordPress installations</li>
            <li>One (1) year of plugin updates delivered via our update server</li>
            <li>One (1) year of priority email support</li>
            <li>Access to all Pro features for the licensed site(s)</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4">
            After your license term expires, the plugin continues to function, but you will no longer
            receive updates or support unless you renew your license.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>License Scope:</strong> Licenses are non-transferable and may not be resold, shared,
            or redistributed. Each license key is for your use only on the permitted number of sites.
          </p>
        </section>

          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-text mb-4">Refund Policy</h2>

            from customers with a pattern of repeated purchases and refunds.

          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Renewal refunds:</strong> Refunds for subscription renewals must be requested within 7 days

          <p>
            Pro and Agency licenses are subscription-based and renew automatically at the end of each
            license term unless canceled.

          <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mt-4">
            <li>You will receive a reminder email before your subscription renews</li>
            <li>You may cancel auto-renewal at any time from your account</li>
            <li>Canceled subscriptions remain active until the end of the current billing period</li>
            <li>After cancellation, you retain access to the plugin but lose update and support access</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="mt-4">
            <strong>Pricing changes:</strong> If you cancel and later wish to renew, you will be charged
            the current pricing at that time. Previous promotional or grandfathered rates cannot be restored.
